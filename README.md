# Gnomey Vim

Gnomey Vim is a plugin for Vim the text editor that registers all edited
documents with the default Gnome Recent Manager so that you can easily reach
your files from Gnome-shell or simply from file chooser dialogs.

## Requirements

To use this extension, you need Vim with support for Python. Run `vim --version
| grep +python` to see if you have it.

Next requirement is `pygtk` and that should be all.

## Installation

enjoy!
